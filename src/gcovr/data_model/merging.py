Merge coverage data.

All of these merging function have the signature
``merge(T, T) -> T``.
That is, they take two coverage data items and combine them,
returning the combined coverage.
This may change the input objects, so that they should be used afterwards.

In a mathematical sense, all of these ``merge()`` functions
must behave somewhat like an addition operator:

* commutative: order of arguments must not matter,
  so that ``merge(a, b)`` must match ``merge(a, b)``.
* associative: order of merging must not matter,
  so that ``merge(a, merge(b, c))`` must match ``merge(merge(a, b), c)``.
* identity element: there must be an empty element,
  so that ``merge(a, empty)`` and ``merge(empty, a)`` and ``a`` all match.
  However, the empty state might be implied by “parent dict does not contain an entry”,
  or must contain matching information like the same line number.

The insertion functions insert a single coverage item into a larger structure,
for example inserting BranchCoverage into a LineCoverage object.
The target/parent structure is updated in-place,
otherwise this has equivalent semantics to merging.
In particular, if there already is coverage data in the target with the same ID,
then the contents are merged.
The insertion functions return the coverage structure that is saved in the target,
which may not be the same as the input value.
