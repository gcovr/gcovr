This test case tests the output of cascaded html coverage
reports. It will test that a directory with items in it properly
aggregates the statistics within it, all the sorting works for
each directory, any flattening of directories that have a single
entry, and the writing of source files within each directory.

In this case, the directory listings should be sorted by
uncovered lines.
