Known bugs
==========

This list contains bugs for version 6.0 and newer, always check the latest
version of this file available `here <https://gcovr.com/en/latest/known_bugs.html>`_.

.. _fix_1171_1:

Branch exclusion comments remove the branches complete and do not affect conditions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. list-table::

   * - Introduced
     - :ref:`release_8_0`

   * - Fixed
     - :ref:`next_release`, :issue:`1171`

If a line is excluded by comments and contains branches and conditions, the branches,
conditions are excluded and the decision is cleared.
If branches are excluded by comments they are removed completely and the conditions
are not touched and still reported.
With the fix the branch exclusion comments are excluding the branches and conditions
and clear the decision the same way as it is done if a whole line is excluded.

.. _fix_1171_2:

Excluded branches ar still reported in LCOV report
--------------------------------------------------

.. list-table::

   * - Introduced
     - :ref:`release_8_4`

   * - Fixed
     - :ref:`next_release`, :issue:`1171`

When a line with branches is excluded the branch exclusion flag is
ignored and there are still ``BRDA`` lines created in the ``LCOV`` report.

.. _fix_1165:

Multiple counters for same line are not merged in coveralls report
------------------------------------------------------------------

.. list-table::

   * - Introduced
     - :ref:`release_8_4`

   * - Fixed
     - :ref:`next_release`

Since version 8.4 there can be several coverage elements for same line. This data
isn't merged in coveralls report. The elements are added as several elements to the
``coverage`` list in the coveralls report which result in wrong data for the
following lines.

.. _fix_1138:

Wrong data used in clover report
--------------------------------

.. list-table::

   * - Introduced
     - :ref:`release_7_1`

   * - Fixed
     - :ref:`release_8_4`

- ``loc`` contains the highest line number with coverage information instead of lines of the file.
- ``ncloc`` contains the number of reportable lines instead of the lines of the file without comments.
- ``statements`` and ``coveredstatements`` are always set to zero but lines of type ``stmt`` are added
  to the report.

.. _fix_1137:

Discrepancy between exclusion and removal of coverage data
----------------------------------------------------------

.. list-table::

   * - Introduced
     - :ref:`release_8_0`

   * - Fixed
     - :ref:`release_8_4`

- The internal functions where removed but the line coverage was only excluded. Now the line
  coverage data is also removed.
- The coverage of a whole line was removed if a function started on this line, even if the line
  coverage belongs to another function. Now only the data for this function is removed.

.. _fix_1130:

Files without functions and lines are added to report
-----------------------------------------------------

.. list-table::

   * - Introduced
     - :ref:`release_8_0`

   * - Fixed
     - :ref:`release_8_4`, :issue:`1130`

Files without functions and lines from ``gcov`` JSON report are added to data model.

  {
    "file": "/path/to/file.h",
    "functions": [],
    "lines": []
  }

.. _fix_1126:

Wrong handling of functions with specialization
-----------------------------------------------

.. list-table::

   * - Introduced
     - :ref:`release_8_3`

   * - Fixed
     - :ref:`release_8_4`, :issue:`1126`

- With gcc-5, gcc-6 and clang compiler functions with specializations
  (template functions) use one block in the output which starts with all
  names. All functions are added to the data model but only the last one
  has coverage data (of all functions). A debug message is printed for
  each function which will not contain any line coverage.

  **This can't be changed on our side because of missing information.**

.. code-block::

          -:   11:   }
          4:   12:}

- For gcc-8 and newer (unless GCOV JSON is used) the output of functions
  with specialization starts with a block with overall coverage followed
  by a block for each specialized function. If a normal function was in
  front of this block the overall counts where added to this function.

  This data is now removed again after detecting the specialization and a
  debug message is printed.

- A forced inline function does not contain a function name in the
  output. If the function is at the begin of the output it is ignored
  and a debug message is printed.
  In the middle of the file it is still added to the previous function.

  **This canâ€™t be changed on our side because of missing information.**

.. _fix_1092:

Error if conditions for the same line are reported different across GCOV data files
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. list-table::

   * - Introduced
     - :ref:`release_8_3`

   * - Fixed
     - :ref:`release_8_4`, :issue:`1092`

The number and the order of the items reported by ``GCOV`` can differ between the compilation
units or between the runs. With the fix the data is merged if they have the same properties
instead of the position in the list which failed because of the different properties.
The properties taken into account are described in :ref:`json_output`

E.g. from a project ``GCOV`` reported following data for a line defined in a header.

.. _fix_1089:

JaCoCo report does not follow the DTD schema
--------------------------------------------

.. list-table::

   * - Introduced
     - :ref:`release_7_0`

   * - Fixed
     - :ref:`release_8_4`, :issue:`1089`

.. _fix_1085:

Multiple functions with same name in Cobertura report
-----------------------------------------------------

.. list-table::

   * - Introduced
     - :ref:`release_8_3`

   * - Fixed
     - :ref:`release_8_4`, :issue:`1085`

``Cobertura`` report contains multiple functions with same name for virtual destructors and const overloads.

.. _fix_1080:

Missing excluded property for condition in JSON report
------------------------------------------------------

.. list-table::

   * - Introduced
     - :ref:`release_8_3`

   * - Fixed
     - :ref:`release_8_4`, :issue:`1080`

``JSON`` report doesn't contain ``excluded`` property for conditions and calls.

.. _fix_1066:

Wrong log message: Deprecated config key None used, please use ...
------------------------------------------------------------------

.. list-table::

   * - Introduced
     - :ref:`release_8_3`

   * - Fixed
     - :ref:`release_8_4`, :issue:`1066`

The log message ``Deprecated config key None used, please use 'txt-metric=branch' instead.`` is printed
even if the mentioned key is used.

.. _fix_1048:

Negative counters in GCOV JSON intermediate file are not handled
----------------------------------------------------------------

.. list-table::

   * - Introduced
     - :ref:`release_8_0`

   * - Fixed
     - :ref:`release_8_3`, :issue:`1048`

Because of a bug in GCOV (see `<https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=68080>`_)
we can get negative counter values in the GCOV reports.
The handling of this negative counters was missing is missing if we use JSON
intermediate file.

.. _fix_1037:

Wrong source root in Cobertura report
-------------------------------------

.. list-table::

   * - Introduced
     - :ref:`release_6_0`

   * - Fixed

-----------------------------------------

.. list-table::

   * - Introduced
     - :ref:`release_7_0`

   * - Fixed

   * - Introduced
     - :ref:`release_8_2`
