Getting Started
===============

The ``gcovr`` command provides a summary of the lines that have been
executed in a program.  Code coverage statistics help you discover
untested parts of a program, which is particularly important when
assessing code quality.  Well-tested code is a characteristic of
high quality code, and software developers often assess code coverage
statistics when deciding if software is ready for a release.
